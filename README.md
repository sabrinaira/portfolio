I had a great time when I created my [very first portfolio website](https://github.com/sabrinaira/portfolio-v1) that was built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. So, I decided to take a step further and create a brand new one that will showcase my current capabilities after much time has passed. Looking back at it now, I am very proud of how far I've come since I started learning how to code.

## Features:
- Built with React's modular components for consistent and organized structure.
- Components and elements are styled using Sass for improved organization, consistent design and readability.
- A lot of hovering effects!
- Responsive layout for both desktop and mobile screens!

## Stretch feature(s):
- Integrate my blog feed to connect visitors to also see my blogging site!
- Add dark mode color scheme
