  "bio": [
    "Born and raised in New York City, I've always been drawn to creative expression. This led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts in the Philippines, where I immersed myself in visual storytelling and artistic techniques.",
    "Returning to the U.S., I launched my career as a freelance artist and content creator, specializing in digital art and social media management. My creative work expanded into script writing and transcription, giving me experience across multiple forms of media and communication.",
    "Through this journey, I rediscovered my fascination with computers and technologyâ€”a passion that had been with me since childhood, when I became my family's go-to person for technical support. This rekindled interest ultimately inspired me to pivot into web development. I began deepening my understanding of IT fundamentals while finding myself captivated by the intersection of creativity and code, where artistic vision meets technical innovation.",
    "Today, I focus on building modern web applications using JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I'm constantly expanding my knowledge of web programming fundamentals and IT principles while exploring cutting-edge technologies that solve real-world problems and create meaningful user experiences."
